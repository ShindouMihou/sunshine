<!-- TO PEOPLE FORKING, PLEASE CHANGE THIS TO YOUR OWN LETTER -->
**To whom is reading this letter,**

Every day has been almost as if a blessing to me ever since you came to my life. I thank every single day to fate who allowed us to be together.
You are my sunshine. You are the person who I think about the most. Although we had arguments, you never left my side. You lit my day every night 
as you call me on my phone.

I feel like a child when I am with you, it's still unbelievable to this day how we got together. I love you so much and will continue to love you 
even more till the end of the days.

**With love from Yours Only, Anonymous**
